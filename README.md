## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Sass
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

within the time frame from the start to finish was a time well spent acquiring knowledge. Climbing to a higher heirarchy shows there is more to be learnt. This project has helped me improve more on my critical thing when it comes to checkmating errors in JS and I can say I have added some knowledge to what I previously have.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
const [info, setInfo] = useState({
        fullname: '',
        cardNumber: '',
        cardMonth: '',
        cardYear: '',
        cardCvv: ''
    });
```

### Continued development

I will put in more effort in learning more react components and utilizing them in the best possible standard.
